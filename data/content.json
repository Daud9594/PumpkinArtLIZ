  "aboutText": "My name is Elizaveta Morris. I am an artist passionate about bringing animals and people to life on paper. Each portrait I create is more than just a drawing \u2014 it\u2019s a memory, an emotion, a story. I fell in love with pencil art in childhood, and since then it has become my way to connect with the world and with people.",
